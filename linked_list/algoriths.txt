Sure! Here’s a comprehensive list of algorithms and common problems based on **linked lists** that you can study or implement. I’ll categorize them roughly by difficulty and topic:

---

### Basic Linked List Operations

1. Traverse a linked list
2. Insert a node at the beginning
3. Insert a node at the end
4. Insert a node at a given position
5. Delete a node from the beginning
6. Delete a node from the end
7. Delete a node at a given position
8. Search for an element in a linked list
9. Count the number of nodes
10. Reverse a linked list (iterative)
11. Reverse a linked list (recursive)
12. Find the length of a linked list

### Intermediate Linked List Algorithms

13. Detect a loop in a linked list (Floyd’s Cycle Detection / Tortoise and Hare)
14. Find the start node of the loop in a linked list
15. Remove a loop from a linked list
16. Check if a linked list is a palindrome
17. Find the middle of the linked list (using slow and fast pointers)
18. Merge two sorted linked lists
19. Merge K sorted linked lists (using heap or divide & conquer)
20. Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list
21. Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list
22. Intersection point of two linked lists (find the node where two lists intersect)
23. Detect and remove cycle in a linked list
24. Clone a linked list with random pointers
25. Pairwise swap elements of a linked list

### Advanced Linked List Problems

26. Flatten a multilevel linked list (where nodes have child pointers)
27. Add two numbers represented by linked lists
28. Reverse nodes in k-group chunks
29. Rotate a linked list by k nodes
30. Sort a linked list using Merge Sort
31. Sort a linked list using Quick Sort
32. Delete a node given only access to that node (no head pointer)
33. Find the nth node from the end of the linked list
34. Convert a binary number represented as linked list to decimal
35. Find if linked list is a palindrome using O(1) space
36. Intersection of two linked lists (using hashing or two-pointer approach)
37. XOR linked list (memory efficient doubly linked list)
38. Split a circular linked list into two halves
39. Reverse alternate nodes in a linked list and append at the end
40. Rotate a linked list to the right or left by k nodes
41. Swap nodes in pairs without swapping data
42. Rearrange linked list such that all even nodes appear after odd nodes
